Hi, I'm Little Fox.
===

I'm a simple, elegant WordPress theme for Photographers. I especially target photographers with a darker photography style, as most my theme is based on the color white. 

What I include
--------------

* A Home Page template with a full-screen feature photo, a headline box, a Pinterest-esque "Recent Work" section, a blog callout, an "About Me" section, and a simple contact form.
* A Portfolio template. All Blog posts you categorize as Portfolio will end up on the Portfolio page. I'll show you how to set that up.
* A Blog template.
* A customized 404 (Page not found!) template.
* Support for Contact Form 7
